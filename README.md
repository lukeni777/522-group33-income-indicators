# How to Run the Data Analysis
To replicate our analysis on your machine:
1. Clone this GitHub Repository on your local machine:
   * Click the green ``` Code <> ``` button and copy the URL.
   * On your local machine's terminal, navigate to the location where you would like this repository to reside in.
   * Run the command ``` git clone <URL> ``` in the terminal.
2. Creating the virtual environment
   * Navigate to the cloned repository on your machine. Ensure you are in the root of the repository.
   * Run the command ``` conda env create --file environment.yaml ``` in the terminal. Or use ``` conda-lock install --name condalock-new conda-lock.yml ``` which might be faster.
   * Activate the virtual environment by running the following command in the terminal: ``` conda activate DSCI_522_project_env ```
